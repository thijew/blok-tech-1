# Blok-Tech

For Blok-Tech I made an application where customers can reserve their chicken, so that they don't come to the shop for nothing. The owner will be able to see how many reservations there will be for which day and time.

## Features

The customer will be able to fill in a form with some basic information about themselves and the amount of chickens they want. The client will then get a text message with a confirmation message and an option to cancel. 

The client will be able to see the reservations per day and the weather conditions for the day. The weather conditions are important because on hot days it is a lot busier. The client will also be able to see some information about the client in case they need to contact the customer.
