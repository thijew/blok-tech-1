### concept ideas

So I am going to be making the web application for an actual company, located on a camping close to the sea. The company is called "Het Kippaleis" it's a company which primary sells grilled chicken and fries. The grilled chickens are very popular and often sold out. That is why the client wants a reservation system so that they can make a better estimation of how many they are going to sell. The chickens have to grill for at least 2 hours and they start selling them at 5. That is why we want the reservation program to close at 2. The client also wants the customers to be able to order to far in advance. That's why we will limit it to a week.

- A form where customers can fill in how many chickens they want, when they want them and some basic information about them.
- A payment system to make the customer pay for a deposit.
- Find basic information about the company.
- Being able to save their information for future orders.
- Log in feature

### 5 Job stories

- When a new user enters my site, I want them to able to find the order form easily, so that I can know what they want to reserve.
- When a user fills in the form, I want the user to be able to post the information, so that I can send them an confirmation email.
- When a new user enters my site, I want them to be able to find some basic information about the company, so that the company doesn't get too many faq.
- When a user fills in the form, I want the information to be stored so that, I can autofill it for them in future reservations.

## Job story

For my final job story I am going to focus on the first job story:
