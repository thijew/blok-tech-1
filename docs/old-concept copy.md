### Chosen job story

#### An app where people who are into punk music and the scene can find each other, to go to concerts together or exchange music

### concept ideas

So the target audience is going to be the punk scene. The ages go from 16 to 70 years old, but since this is an app I would expect it to be used in the younger generation. The look and feel off the app should obviously be dark and give that metal/punk feeling. The main user interactions could be:

- login and creating an account
- Filling in a form about your music taste
- Being able to connect with each other and share music.
- Liking an other users profile.


### 5 Job stories

- When a new user enters my site, I want them to able to log in and create an account, so I can connect them with each other.
- When a user create's a profile , I want the user to fill in a form of some basic information, so that I can base my filter options off of that.
- When a user clicks on an other users profile, I want them to be able to see some information about them, so that they can like their profile.
- When a user likes an other user, I want them to be able to send a message to each other, so that they can connect.
- When a user fills in the exact same information as an other user, I want them to get a special message.
